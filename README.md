# google-or-practise 

In order to run the code first you need to install google-or-tools in your local machine https://developers.google.com/optimization/install/cpp/linux.  
I'm using google-or-tools v9.3.10502.  
Once you have the downloaded the tar file from the official website, extract it and change to the root folder.


### To test your installation run
```
make test_cc
```
Save your program as a .cc file inside the root folder.  


### To run you code :
```
make run SOURCE=/relative/pathto/root
```
