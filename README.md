# pgRouting - Routing on PostgreSQL

## STATUS

The *master* branch mostly reflects our current 1.05 release. We are working on a major feature release 2.0.0 in the *develop* branch. We are currently in *alpha* stage of development and things are very stable. The 2.0 release is not backwards compatible with the 1.x releases because we have totally restructured the API and the source code to position the product for additional future growth. Once you see all the new functionality that we have added and the simplier API design we thing you will be very happy with the results.
