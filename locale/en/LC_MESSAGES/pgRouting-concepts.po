"Typically when GIS files are loaded into the data database for use with "

"create a useful topology the data needs to be \"noded\". This means that "
"where two or more roads form an intersection there it needs to be a node "
"at the intersection and all the road segments need to be broken at the "
"intersection, assuming that you can navigate from any of these segments "
"to any other segment via that intersection."

"You can use the :ref:`graph analysis functions <analytics>` to help you "

"For example, when you have an overpass and underpass intersection, you do"
